《通用规范汉字表》 is an official character list by the Chinese government's Ministry of Education, published in June 2013.  There are three levels:

- 一级字表 (level 1): 3500 characters (all of these were included in MteH v0.1.1);
- 二级字表 (level 2): 6500 characters;
- 三级字表 (level 3): 1605 characters.

The level 1 characters are described as 常用字 = "common-use characters".  The level 2 and 3 characters were not added to MteH v0.1.1 during this process (but some might have been added in other steps in constructing MteH v0.1.1).

The 3500 level-1 characters were sourced from [WikiSource](https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E9%80%9A%E7%94%A8%E8%A7%84%E8%8C%83%E6%B1%89%E5%AD%97%E8%A1%A8), which was extracted fom the [pdf](https://www.gov.cn/gzdt/att/att/site1/20130819/tygfhzb.pdf) of 《通用规范汉字表》.
