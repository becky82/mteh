The file `K-5 Word Frequency Dictionary Bands XLS format.xls` was originally sourced from `mandarininstitute.org`, but this link seems broken now.  It contains 3349 words from which 1817 characters were extracted.

In the Excel spreadsheet, the character 丢 is incorrectly encoded as the "lookalike character" 丟 [#2851].  All the characters in this file were included in MteH v0.1.1.
