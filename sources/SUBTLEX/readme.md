The SUBTLEX dataset is provided by the paper Qing Cai and Marc Brysbaert, "SUBTLEX-CH: Chinese Word and Character Frequencies Based on Film Subtitles", PLoS One, 2010.  It can be downloaded from [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010729).

The file SUBTLEX-CH-CHR contains character frequencies, but is encoded using GBK.  By opening the raw file in the Firefox browser, and copy/pasting the result to a text file, we can obtain a Unicode version of the SUBTLEX-CH-CHR.
