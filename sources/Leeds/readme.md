The Leeds Chinese corpus was originally sourced from `corpus.leeds.ac.uk`, but this link seems broken now; it is still downloadable from archive.org via [this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20230607215808/http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/frqc/internet-zh.num).  It's a list of 50000 "words" (where "words" includes puctuation marks, English words, phrases, and other non-words) sourced from the Internet.

The relevant paper is here:

The top 20000 "words" were used, and all the Chinese characters therein where extracted, resulting in a list of 3654 characters, of which the following (65+4) were removed:

and the rest (3585) were all included in MteH v0.1.1.
