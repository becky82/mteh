The top-10000 Chinese character frequencies on Wikipedia (2015) were downloaded from [Chinese Character Frequencies](https://czielinski.github.io/hanzifreq/hanzifreq/output/frequencies.html) (which was generated using [hanzifreq](https://github.com/czielinski/hanzifreq)).

A large number of characters were filtered out (too many to list), such as:

> 〇 㗎 㚟 㟋 㟖 㦃 㩼 㵲 㹴 㼈 䃟 䄉 䓪 䓬 䗉  [...] 𣚦 𣴓 𤨒 𧊒 𧒽 𨦡 𨧀 𨨏 𨭆 𨭎 𩷶 𪘅 𪹚

(Many of these filtered-out characters can't even be easily displayed.)  This brought the number of characters down to 6588.  From the top-3500 characters, we removed (225+8):
