The [LWC corpus](https://lwc.daanvanesch.nl/openaccess.php) is a Chinese word corpus derived from Sina Weibo (Chinese "tweets").

The top 20000 "words" from this corpus were used, and all the Chinese characters therein where extracted, resulting in a list of 3585 characters.  After removing traditional characters, we had 3393 characters, of which the following (55+3) were removed:
