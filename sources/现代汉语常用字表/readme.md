《现代汉语常用字表》 is an official character list by the Chinese government's Ministry of Education, published in 1988.  It has 3500 of the most frequently used simplified Chinese characters.

All but two of these 3500 characters (秕 and 苫) were added to MteH v0.1.1, sourced from [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:List_of_Frequently_Used_Characters_in_Modern_Chinese).
