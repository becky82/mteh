Dr. Alan Hoenig has a book *Learn & Remember 2,178 Characters and Their Meanings* (2009).  The author has given permission to share the unit reviews to that book (uploaded as `Hoenig_unit_reviews.pdf`), from which we can extract the corpus (listed under "Characters: Original Listing", read top-to-bottom).  The corpus is also available as a [Skritter](https://skritter.com/vocablists/view/34423431) deck.

The Skritter deck contains two bugs:

- Unit 79, item 21: 覆 is incorrectly 复
- Unit 85, item 7: 乾 is incorrectly 干

And Hoenig's book lists 攸 twice: (a) Unit 81, char 2003 (item 3 in Skritter), and (b) Unit 82, char 2031 (item 5 in Skritter).

All (2151) except the following characters (26):
