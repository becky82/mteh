Chih-Hao Tsai has a [Chinese character corpus](https://technology.chtsai.org/charfreq/) sourced from Usenet newsgroups during 1993-1994; it includes both simplified and traditional characters.

From the top-3500 characters therein, 1328 were not included in MteH v0.1.1, primarily because they are traditional-only characters.  If they are converted to simplified using [OpenCC](https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC), then the list of characters not included in MteH v0.1.1 are:

> 丌 仄 仟 佇 佫 佮 倌 偈 儂 儕 厝 叡 吋 呎 唷 啾 嘸 噱 囡 壢 妳 娑 寮 寰 屌 屐 岐 岫 岱 嵐 嶸 徜 徬 恁 懋 擷 旻 昀 昱 昶 暱 暸 曜 曦 梓 樽 毓 淼 瀨 煒 煚 煜 燄 牠 狷 珮 琨 琮 瑄 瑋 瑛 璟 疋 矽 砲 祂 祇 祐 祺 禎 筠 筱 篠 羯 胏 臆 舖 芷 苓 茍 荳 莒 莘 萱 蒞 蕙 薔 蚵 蟄 袂 訶 詗 迋 逕 遨 郤 酹 鈺 銓 鎧 鏘 鐸 雋 雯 霈 霖 靨 韜 颺 饗 魎 鰱

Note that MteH v0.1.1 contains 兀 (not 丌) and 苟 (not 茍).
