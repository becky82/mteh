## Purpose
This simplified character corpus is intended to be a set of simplified Chinese characters which will make a good "finishing line" for advanced students.  Basically, if you learn these characters, you're practically "done" studying simplified Chinese characters.

This list of characters merges the following corpora:

1. HSK 1.0 (2905 characters);
2. HSK 2.0 (2663 characters);
3. HSK 3.0 (3000 characters);
4. Heisig and Richardson (3018 characters);
5. the Taiwanese TOCFL vocabulary list (characters extracted from 7989 words; 妳 and 牠 were excluded);
6. the top 3500 characters from [Jun Da's modern corpus](https://lingua.mtsu.edu/chinese-computing/statistics/char/list.php?Which=MO) (後 was excluded);
7. the top 3500 characters from the SUBTLEX character dataset (妳, 後, 菈, and 円 were excluded);
8. the top 3500 characters from HanziCraft's frequency database (彷, 後, 於 were excluded);
9. K-5 Word Frequency Dictionary (originally sourced from `mandarininstitute.org`), which contains 3349 words from which 1817 characters were extracted;
10. the top 20000 words from the Leeds corpus, which contained 3655 characters;
11. the top 20000 words from the BLCU ``global'' corpus, which contained 3917 characters, and after filtering we obtained 3700 characters (excluded characters include 丶, 亞, 伱, 佢, 來, 係, 個, 們, 備, 傳, ...);
12. the top 20000 words from the [Leiden Weibo Corpus](http://lwc.daanvanesch.nl/openaccess.php), which contained 3585 characters, and after filtering we obtained 3393 characters (excluded characters include 丶, 來, 係, 個, 們, 備, 傷, 內, 兩, ...);
