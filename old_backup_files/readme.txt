This was my (Rebecca J. Stones) original version that I had been working on offline for a long time.  I add it here as a backup (it helps me remember how everything originated), and because the .pdfs give an indication as to where my thoughts are at.  At the time of uploading, I had "done" page 31 in the pdf (so 3100 characters).  It wasn't complete; I switched to using Github mid-way.  After I improve the remaining hints, it might serve as a first version I'd be willing to make public.

For the first iteration, I automatically added the most common words with a given character.  I found this wasn't suitable as many hints were like "x树" and there's many different possible x's, but it was a good starting point.  I've gone through this list manually while doing handwriting practice (I think I'm up to 4 times now), I've found:

- ideally we can use the hint as a cloze phrase e.g. from [blank]绒服 we can infer the blank is 羽 (this is not always possible with 4-character hints);
- since they're hints, we don't have to (and it's often better not to) preserve grammatical accuracy (but, if it's easy to be grammatical, we might as well);
- longer hints are almost always better;
- collocations often make excellent hints (e.g., single character adjectives: 不[blank]不矮 is 不高不矮);
- commonly occurring chengyu that contain unique characters make excellent hints (根深蒂固 is great for 蒂);
- generally I've assumed the audience is an advanced student;
- I try to match the tenor to the character (e.g., 书面语 vs. 口语);
- I try to make the hint match the most common context in which the reader will encounter the character (not always possible).
- I try my best to make hints apolitical and unoffensive.

I get hints from:

- Sometimes I write them myself (off the top of my head), or I encounter words/chengyu in my reading that I think would make a good hint.
- Sometimes I use Pleco, YouDao, 《现代汉语词典》 or other dictionaries or example sentence databases.
- Sometimes Google autocomplete gives good suggestions (or Google image search).
- Now that AI is a thing (I started this project before these modern AIs existed), I ask ChatGPT for hints; sometimes they're good, but othertimes they need refinement, or ChatGPT completely misses the best possible hint.

I uploaded a photo of what I've been doing for handwriting practice and editing the files:

- I first fill in the boxes with my handwriting (off the top of my head);
- For the characters I couldn't remember correctly, I color the boxes in blue, then handwrite those characters;
- This page shows my editing process: in orange pen, I note changes I'd like to make to the hints;
- And when I make the changes, I tick them off.
